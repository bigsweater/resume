      ## Since 2006, I've launched Web experiences for a diverse clientele that includes other design and development shops, marketing organizations, nonprofits, and _Fortune_ 500 companies.

      <hr class="noprint">

      I love the Web, open source, and user experience design. I don't claim to know everything, but I'm a voracious learner, and I'm always studying some aspect of design or programming in an effort to improve. (I'm a pretty quick study, too!)

      Interests include art, business, and technology---and especially the place where all those things intersect.

              In the last ten years, my freelance practice has evolved from producing simple marketing websites to more advanced CMS-based sites using WordPress and other technologies; now, I'm consulting and contracting under the Big Sweater banner. Projects have included:

              - Javascript and jQuery solutions to marketing problems
              - Open source contributions (and even a few of my own projects)

              [Home Decorators Collection](http://www.homedecorators.com), a Home Depot company, brought me on board to assist with the launch of their newly-redesigned website, and I ended up staying for almost two years. Working with the HDC team, I:

              - Implemented development best practices, introducing the team to tools like Git for version control and Vagrant for isolated, reproducible development environments
              - Consulted with management to vet new hires
              - Oversaw new front-end hire training
              - Improved the UX of critical website sections
              - Designed, built, and deployed Web assets
              - Designed, built, and deployed marketing emails, many reaching an audience of over 1 million users
