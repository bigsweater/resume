    ## A designer who develops, and a developer who designs

      Since 2006, I've launched Web experiences for a diverse clientele that includes other design and development shops, marketing organizations, nonprofits, and _Fortune_ 500 companies.

      I'm passionate about the Web, open source, and user experience. I bring enthusiasm, strong work ethic, and broad experience to every project I take on. I do not claim to know everything, but I'm a voracious learner, and I'm always studying some aspect of design or programming in an effort to improve. (I'm a pretty quick study, too!)

          <div class="event-desc">

            In the last ten years, my freelance practice has evolved from producing simple marketing websites to more advanced CMS-based sites using WordPress and other technologies; now, I'm consulting and contracting under the Big Sweater banner.

            Projects have included websites, WordPress themes and plugins, branding, UX design, and consulting.

            _Fun fact!_ "Maglione" means "sweater" in Italian. So now you know where the name came from.
